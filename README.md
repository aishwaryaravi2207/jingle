## üéØ Overview

Jingle is a comprehensive music streaming application that provides users with a personalized music experience. Built with a robust MVC architecture, it features user authentication, playlist management, and an intelligent recommendation system powered by collaborative filtering algorithms.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### MVC Pattern Implementation

The application follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern:

#### **Frontend (View)**
- **JSP (Java Server Pages)**: Dynamic content rendering
- **HTML**: Web structure and layout
- **CSS**: Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: User interaction handling and dynamic behavior

#### **Controller**
- **Java Servlets**: Application flow control and request handling
- **Functionality**:
  - Route management between JSP pages
  - Backend communication via helper classes
  - Data flow orchestration between frontend and backend

#### **Backend (Model)**
- **Database**: MySQL Workbench (SQL)
- **Data Structure**: Relational tables with foreign key relationships
- **Model Classes**: Data representation and database interaction
- **Server**: Apache Tomcat deployment container

### Architecture Flow
1. User interactions captured by JavaScript in the frontend
2. Servlets control application flow and call appropriate JSP pages
3. Backend interaction through helper classes
4. Data storage and retrieval via SQL queries in MySQL Workbench

## ‚ú® Features

### üîê User Authentication & Personalization
- **Secure Login/Logout**: Credential validation against database
- **Account Registration**: Unique email-based registration with duplicate detection
- **Profile Management**: Profile picture display with default fallback
- **Dynamic Greeting**: Time-based personalized greetings
  - Morning: "Good morning, [User]!"
  - Afternoon: "Good afternoon, [User]!"
  - Evening: "Good evening, [User]!"
  - Night: "Good night, [User]!"

### üéõÔ∏è User Interface
- **Navigation Menu**: Seamless app navigation without manual scrolling
- **Account Section**: User information display and management
- **Search Functionality**: Keyword-based music search with instant results

### üéµ Music Features
- **Recently Played**: Display of 10 most recent tracks
- **Trending Songs**: Top 5 most played songs across the platform
- **Albums**: Comprehensive album catalog with associated songs
- **Playlists**: Personal playlist management
- **Artists**: Curated artist directory

### üéÆ Playback Controls
- **Dynamic Song Card**: Real-time display of currently playing track
- **Playback Controls**:
  - Play/Pause toggle
  - Next/Previous track navigation
  - Loop/Unloop functionality
  - Add/Remove from playlist
  - Mute/Unmute audio
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar with time indicators

## ü§ñ Recommendation System

### Implementation Approach
The application employs a sophisticated recommendation system combining multiple techniques:

#### **Popularity-Based Recommendations**
- Songs ranked by total listen count across all users
- SQL query-driven approach for top 5 trending tracks
- No separate ML model required

#### **Collaborative Filtering** ‚≠ê
**Primary recommendation engine** using user behavior analysis:

##### **Data Preparation**
- Matrix construction with userId, songId, and play count
- User-song interaction matrix formation

##### **Algorithm Implementation**
- **Matrix Factorization**: Decomposition into M1 √ó M2 matrices
- **Alternating Least Squares**: 10-iteration optimization process
- **Prediction**: Empty matrix cell value prediction for recommendations

##### **Technical Stack**
- **Flask**: Web framework for recommendation API
- **Python**: Core algorithm implementation
- **Integration**: Seamless connection with Java backend

### Recommendation Logic
```
Users/Songs | S1 | S2 | S3
------------|----|----|----
U1          | ?  | 2  | 6
U2          | 3  | 2  | ?
U3          | ?  | ?  | 5
```

The system identifies users with similar listening patterns and suggests songs based on collaborative preferences.
